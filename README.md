ðŸ“° Fake News Classifier

This project implements a machine learning-based classifier to detect whether a news article is real or fake. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data and trains a model for binary classification.

ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

The classifier uses a dataset of labeled news articles, vectorizes the text using TF-IDF, and applies a Logistic Regression model to predict the authenticity of the news.

ðŸ“Š Technologies & Libraries Used
	â€¢	Python
	â€¢	NumPy
	â€¢	Pandas
	â€¢	Scikit-learn
	â€¢	TfidfVectorizer
	â€¢	Logistic Regression
	â€¢	Jupyter Notebook

ðŸš€ Features
	â€¢	Preprocesses the news text data using TF-IDF vectorization
	â€¢	Splits data into training and test sets
	â€¢	Trains a Logistic Regression model
	â€¢	Evaluates the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix
	â€¢	Predicts news authenticity on custom input

ðŸ“ˆ Model Workflow
	1.	Load and explore dataset
	2.	Preprocess text using TfidfVectorizer
	3.	Split data into training and testing sets
	4.	Train a Logistic Regression model
	5.	Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy and confusion matrix
	6.	Make predictions on new text inputs

âœ… How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository or download the .ipynb notebook.
	2.	Install the required libraries:(pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn)
	3.	Open the Fake_News_Classifier.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
	4.	Run all the cells sequentially to train the model and test predictions.

ðŸ“Œ Sample Prediction

You can input a custom news article text, and the model will classify it as Real or Fake.
